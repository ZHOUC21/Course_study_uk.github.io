# Support Vector Machine                   
Support Vector Machine is a machine learning method for data classification and prediction. For sake of simplicity, two-dimensional cases are a good beginning to introduce the decision-making by SVM. When mapping data into a two-dimensional diagram, we can see that different types of data tend to converge into different clusters. And the data classification needs to find a margin between different clusters with the maximum width so that the boundary of one data group can be away from the other one as far as possible.
