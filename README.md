# Basic Curiosity_My Notes and Performance of Fundamentals of Operations Research & Analytics

Two weeks' courses have been storaged in the past. As I used to do in physics, I should be intuitively curious about the most simple fundamental of a new course (connecting to my past) and the most frugal orientation of the story (connecting to my future), like the 
principle of least action in physics. The elementary fundamental of the course Operations is our familiar linear programming. And a frugal curiosity is that when I transfer a primal problem into the standard form, whether I can formula the objective function directly by the linear combination of all the constraints, which can obtain the objective value instantly. But the actual cases are more complicated than the our frugal expectations. Firstly when the n(coefficients in the objective function) is greater than the n(constraints), it meas that in the method of undetermined coefficients to compute the weight of each constraint, it would happen that n(equations) > n(variables), in most general cases which would have no solutions. What if n(equations) <= n(variables)? Still we would face some cases with no solutions, like two parallel lines or planes would have no intersection. How can we systemize the discussion above? How can we figure out some subsitute methods to find the optimal (if it exists) when the frugal expectation cannot achieve? How can we figure out whether the optimal solution is unique or not? How can we analyse the linear correlation between different constraints? That's why we need the duality theory to the primal problems, with an inconspicuous bond being excavated by mathematical language, like the duality relation between the location(coordinate) and the momentum of an object.
