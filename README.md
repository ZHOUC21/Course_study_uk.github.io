# Simple Practice in LeetCode_Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters        
1. The first idea comes into my mind is the recursive method.                
2.Two cases: one case is the substring without the first character, the other one is the substring containing the first character.         
3.Can I firstly define a method that can output the index of a repeated character within the given substring?
