# Development Environment Constructed in the Distributed Computing for Big Data                                                                                             
With my original github account taken as private, I decided to register a new github account used for the course Distributed Computing for Big Data. Because one SSH key generated from the Git GUI has been used for the old account, I have to generate a new SSH key by using [](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)                          
                  
                  
                    
                    

                      
**Yours,**
