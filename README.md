# MergeSort                                                                 
Modified by Julia Boettcher 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and Konrad Swanepoel 2018, the recursive version of the MergeSort algorithm (which is a divided and conquer algorithm) can be shown as below. It divides the array to be sorted in two sub-arrays and sorts each of them by dividing each into two sub-arrays and iterates this process inductively. Finally the two sorted sub-arrays can be merged into one sorted arrray.                  
                   
The first critical point to proceed is how we can divide the array to be sorted in two sub-arrays.
